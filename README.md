# ü§ñ Machine Learning and Data Mining

This repository contains core implementations and concepts related to **Machine Learning** and **Data Mining**, with a focus on classification algorithms, context-based learning, and preprocessing techniques.

Each Python script explores a fundamental building block in the ML pipeline ‚Äî from transforming raw data to building linear classifiers and implementing context-aware models.

## üìÅ Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Context Based Classification.py` | Implements a classification model that leverages contextual or environmental data to improve prediction accuracy. Useful in applications where surrounding conditions affect outcomes. |
| `Data Transformation.py` | Contains data preprocessing techniques including normalization, standardization, encoding, and other transformations essential for ML model performance. |
| `Linear Classification.py` | Demonstrates implementation of linear classifiers such as Logistic Regression or Linear SVM, with training and evaluation. |
